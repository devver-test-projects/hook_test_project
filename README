This project tests Devver hooks.

As of 2009-07-30, only one hook is tested: init_database.  See .devver/hooks/init_database.

The init_database hook is a shell script.  If everything works right, it will
output a message confirming success, which should be visible in the client.

Note that the stub Rakefile, db directory, and config/database.yml are all
necessary to trigger execution of the init_database hook.
